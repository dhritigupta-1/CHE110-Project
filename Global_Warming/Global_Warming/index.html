                            <p class="text-first-page"><i><b>Global warming</b></i> is the current increase in temperature of the Earth's surface (both land and water) as well as it's atmosphere. Average temperatures around the world have risen by 0.75°C (1.4°F) over the last 100
                                years about two thirds of this increase has occurred since 1975. In the past, when the Earth experienced increases in temperature it was the result of natural causes but today it is being caused by the accumulation of greenhouse
                                gases in the atmosphere produced by human activities. The natural greenhouse effect maintains the Earth's temperature at a safe level making it possible for humans and many other lifeforms to exist. However, since the Industrial
                                Revolution human activities have significantly enhanced the greenhouse effect causing the Earth's average temperature to rise by almost 1°C. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">This is creating the global warming
                                we see today. To put this increase in perspective it is important to understand that during the last ice age, a period of massive climate change, the average temperature change around the globe was only about 5°C. A long
                                series of scientific research and international studies has shown, with more than 90% certainty, that this increase in overall temperatures is due to the greenhouse gases produced by humans. Activities such as deforestation
                                and the burning of fossil fuels are the main sources of these emissions. These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all the major industrialized countries. Global warming is affecting many places
                                around the world. It is accelerating the melting of ice sheets, permafrost and glaciers which is causing average sea levels to rise. It is also changing precipitation and weather patterns in many different places, making
                                some places dryer, with more intense periods of drought and at the same time making other places wetter, with stronger storms and increased flooding. These changes have affected both nature as well as human society and
                                will continue to have increasingly worse effects if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow at the same pace as today. <br /> <a href="https://bit.ly/32B6EBK" target="blank">https://bit.ly/32B6EBK</a></span>

                            <p class="text-first-page">The cause of global warming is the increasing quantity of greenhouse gases in the our atmosphere produced by human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels or deforestation. These activities produce large amounts of greenhouse
                                gas emissions which is causing global warming. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere to keep the planet warm enough to sustain life, this process is called the greenhouse effect. It is a natural process and
                                without these gases, the Earth would be too cold for humans, plants and other creatures to live. The natural greenhouse effect exists due to the balance of the major types of greenhouse gases. However, when abnormally high
                                levels of these gases accumulate in the air, more heat starts getting trapped and leads to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect. Human-caused emissions have been increasing greenhouse levels which is raising worldwide
                                temperatures and driving global warming. <a href="https://bit.ly/2VTKOqG" target="blank">https://bit.ly/2VTKOqG</a>

                        understand the relative importance of a given source compared to other sources and in developing emissions inventories. <br/>Government or industry personnel use emissions measurements to assess the performance of control strategies.
                        The gas stream can be measured before and after a pollution control device to determine how efficiently it captures pollutants. Emission measurements also are used to determine compliance with regulations limiting the amount of
                        pollution that a source may emit. Measurements can be taken over a short time period (e.g., hours), often referred to as a source test, or with methods that measure on a continuous basis, often called continuous emissions monitoring.
                        Either way, it is important obtain data from samples that are representative of the emission stream using methods that are reliable.</p>
